# Hi! 👋 I'm Domi(nik)
### Computational Physics Student


I am a recent graduate and master's student in physics, with special interest in computational physics and astrophysics. My main motivation is solving complex problems by combining the theoretical knowledge in physics and mathematics that I have acquired throughout my studies with my skills in programming and numerical simulation. 
I'm always seeking new opportunities to learn, and I am excited to explore new opportunities that bring together physics, technology, and innovation.
